# CodeNotes
This is a simple app to keep track of programming resources I've found helpful over the last few months. The app is built using Node, Express, Angular, MongoDB, Gulp, Browserify, and Passport and was mostly intended for me to practice using some of what I've learned in these technologies.

To try it out for yourself, clone the repo, run <code>npm install</code>, <code>gulp</code>, and <code>node server.js</code>.
